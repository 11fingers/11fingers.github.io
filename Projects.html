 	<h1>Megaman</h1>
 	<h2>Java Applet</h2>
 	<p>This is a game that I made in June of 2015 using Java. It's my own version of Megaman X, and it was designed 	using Object Oriented Programming with Eclipse as my IDE. All image editing was done using Adobe Photoshop. The game is complete with a menu, instructions, credits, and scoreboard. There is also music that plays in each of the screens. The objective of the game is to reach the end without the player losing all of their health due to the turrets or enemies.<br><br> The program is run as an applet, and makes use of loops, recursion, RNG, key-press input, as well as searching and sorting algorithms. The animations are done with the Graphics class and applet threads. In addition, the scores and stats after the game is sucessfully finished is appended to a textfile. This textfile is read into a table everytime the user looks at the scoreboard. </p>
    <p>The code for the applet can be found <a href="https://github.com/R-Wang97/Megaman" target="_blank" style="color:#000">here</a>.</p>

      <h1>Space Shooter</h1>
      <h2>Java Applet</h2>
      <p>This is another applet that I made using Java, and it was my first time using Object Oriented Programming. Coding was done through the Eclipse IDE and image editing was done with Adobe Photoshop. It's a simple space game where the user shoots at comets and alien ships with a limited number of lives and bullets. The alien ships will also shoot in addition to move. The applet also makes use of RNG when determining initial locations of the comets and their type. There are also powerups that periodically appear and are available to the player.</p>

 	  <h1>WATWatch</h1>
      <h2>Tiva Launchpad Project</h2>
      <p>WATWatch was a project that I worked on with four other classmates in November 2015. Made for our SE101 Course (Introduction to Methods of Software Engineering), WATWatch is a simple functional smartwatch that takes full use of the hardware capabilities of the Tiva Launchpad and Orbit Booster Pack. WATWatch tracks time, steps, and calories burned in a session. In addition to displaying time, WATWatch also features an alarm, timer, and startwatch. It also displays ambient temperature. <br><br> For this project, we learned how to read input from the Orbit Booster Pack's various hardware features, such as the potentiometer, accelerometer, temperature sensor, switches, and buttons. We also had to learn how to print text onto the LED display of the Booster Pack. Coding was done on a text editor (Sublime Text), and the Energia IDE was used to compile and upload the code into the hardware. Version control and code collaboration was done using Github. The language the code was written was in C.</p>
      <p>The code for the project can be found <a href="https://github.com/Zopper9000/se101project" target="_blank" style="color:#000">here</a>.</p>
