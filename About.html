	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>	Welcome! My name is Shirui, or Ryan, and this is my personal website. I started this website in the summer of 2015 as a project for me to learn the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript) and User Experience Design. I am currently a student enrolled in the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Canada. I love technology, and I want to be able to develop software that works together with hardware to enhance and enrich peoples' daily lives.</p> 
    <p> I've been fascinated by computers ever since I was a child. I would read magazines about both computer hardware and software, and then experiment with various how-to guides such as system optimizaton or overclocking. I built my first PC when I was 10, after selecting and ordering parts online. I first started to dabble in programming when I was in Grade 9 for one of my school courses, and I realized I really enjoyed it. Since then, I've become experienced at both Java and C through personal projects and school courses. One of my current goals is to gain more experience with mobile app and web development.</p>
