	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>	Welcome! My name is Shirui, or Ryan, and this is my personal website. I started this website in the summer of 2015 as a project for me to learn the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript) and User Experience Design. I am currently a student enrolled in the Software Engineering program at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Canada. I love technology, and I want to be able to develop software that works together with hardware to enhance and enrich peoples' daily lives.</p> 
    <p> I've been fascinated by computers ever since I was a child. I would read magazines about both computer hardware and software, and then experiment with various how-to guides such as system optimizaton or overclocking. I built my first PC when I was 10, after selecting and ordering parts online. I first started to dabble in programming when I was in Grade 9 for one of my school courses, and I realized I really enjoyed it. Since then, I've become experienced at both Java and C through personal projects and school courses. One of my current goals is to gain more experience with mobile app and web development.</p>

	<p>While technology fascinates me and is the career I want to persue, one of my longtime hobbies has been music, specfically the piano. I've studied the piano for over 12 years, and I still continue to play currently. It is something I enjoy immensely and am passionate about. I completed all the theory and practical requirements for the RCM ARCT's Diploma in Piano Performance in 2014. I've performed at numerous concerts and also participated in competitions as a solo pianist.</p>
    <p>In addition to the piano, I picked up the Clarinet while in elementary school and continued to play it all the way through high school. I've performed on clarinet too, whether it be in the school wind ensemble or as a part of a chamber ensemble. In high school, I also played piano in the jazz band as well as accompany the school choir. I was also on my school Music Council for three years.</p>
    <p>I'm a lover of Classical, Jazz, Broadway, and Film music. Some composers that really stand out to me are Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Chopin and Liszt. I also love reading books, especially thrillers and classics. Some personal favourites are The Count of Monte Cristo, Gone Girl, and The Godfather. Some of my other interests include modern physics such as relativity, quantum mechanics, and string theory.
